## 2. Subqueries ##

select Major, Unemployment_rate from recent_grads
where Unemployment_rate < (select AVG(Unemployment_rate) from recent_grads)
order by Unemployment_rate

## 3. Subquery In SELECT ##

SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) as float)/CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) from recent_grads) as float) proportion_abv_avg from recent_grads
WHERE ShareWomen > 
(SELECT AVG(ShareWomen) from recent_grads)

## 4. Returning Multiple Results In Subqueries ##

SELECT Major, Major_category FROM recent_grads
WHERE Major_category IN (SELECT Major_category FROM recent_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
ORDER BY SUM(Total) DESC
LIMIT 5)

## 5. Building Complex Subqueries ##

SELECT AVG(cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float)) avg_ratio from recent_grads

## 6. Practice Integrating A Subquery With The Outer Query ##

select Major, Major_category, cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float) ratio from recent_grads
where ratio > (select AVG(cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float)) avg_ratio from recent_grads)
